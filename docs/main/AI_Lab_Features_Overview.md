## Story

This mission is designed to demonstrate the seamless collaboration between AI and human agents in a voice call flow. As a new call enters the system, the AI agent engages the caller with pre-configured questions, collects all relevant details, and then transfers the call to a human agent. The human agent receives a summary of the conversation and can view live transcripts while interacting with the caller, ensuring a smooth and informed customer support experience.


### Key Objectives:
- Capture AI-generated summaries of virtual agent conversations
- Enable real-time call transcription for human agents
- Provide agents with full context before and during live interactions

### Benefits:
- Reduce customer repetition
- Improve agent efficiency and accuracy
- Deliver smoother transitions from AI to human support

By completing this lab, you'll learn how to enhance agent experiences using AI-powered context and live insights.
